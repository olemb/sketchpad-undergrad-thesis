This directory contains the full source code for the c and python
versions of the program, as well as the python wrapper for PABLIO
which you may need to run the python version.

To build the PABLIO wrapper, go to pypablio-0.2 and type 'python
setup.py build' which will give you a .so file or equivalent in the
'build' directory, or 'python setup.py install' which will build and
install it for you. I've included PortAudio v18 so you don't have to
download it to build the wrapper.
