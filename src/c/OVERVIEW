C version
==========


Architecture
--------------

The GUI is written in Python and the rest in C. The recording logic
runs in a separate pthread. Synchronization is achieved through a
lock. The recording thread acquires the lock for every sample buffer
it works on. The GUI thread acquires the lock every time it wants to
call one of the functions in the recording thread's control API.  This
interaction can be seen in _record.c.


Buffers
--------

There size of the recording buffer can be selected at startup with a
command line argument. Two fixed size short arrays are used for
storage (see alloc_buffers() in record.c). The buffer

Extra features: The level of the topmost layer can be adjusted, and it
is possible to record and play back at half speed.


Notable GUI details
--------------------

A peak indicator is used to indicate the combined input/output level.
Input monitoring can
be toggled. There are minute/second ticks in the layer display.


Other things to note
---------------------

main.c, getkey.h and getkey.c implement a console interface to the
program.
