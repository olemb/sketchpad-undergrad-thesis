Python version (unthreaded)
============================

This is the second generation pure Python implementation. The first
version had two threads, a GUI thread and an audio thread. In this
version all code runs in a single thread.

The code was rewritten from scratch, except for a few GUI components
which were borrowed from the threaded version.

Audio I/O is done through a Python wrapper for PABLIO, a blocking API
built on top of PortAudio (http://www.portaudio.com/). Alternatively,
the OSS interface can be used by setting the 1 to 0 in this test in
the top of Recorder.py:

  if 1:
      import pablio
      using_pablio = 1
  else:
      import ossaudio as pablio
      using_pablio = 0

All the GUI code is on record.py, and the recording logic in
Recorder.py. sched.py and _sched.c contain code to turn on realtime
scheduling and lock memory pages in physical memory. These are only
needed when using OSS, since PortAudio will do this on its own if it
finds that it has root privileges.

cmdline.py is a simple one-line console interface to the program.

The program should run without change wherever Python, Tkinter and
PortAudio have been ported, which means Linux, various
Windows-versions and possibly MacOS X. Maybe others as well. The
pypablio module will have to be recompiled for each platform.
